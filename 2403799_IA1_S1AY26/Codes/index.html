        <h4>Chapter 4 Summary</h4>
        <p>In chapter 4 Charlie teaches Micheal the importance of setting goals. He explained that a goal is not
          something
          that happens by chance and is something that is planned and persued.</br>
          charlie stated that those who write down their goals are more likely to achieve them, he then taught Micheal
          how
          to break goals into smaller step whether it be over a long or short period of time.</br></p>
        <h4>Chpater 5 Summary</h4>
        <p>Charlie briefs Micheal on the idea that time is life's most vauable resource and that even thought we all
          have
          24 hours in a day very few of us use it wisely</br>
          He then quoted Mr.Davis who said "we must all suffer from one or two pains: the pain of discipline and the
          pain
          of regret", he then enphasizes that on more urgent matters than what's actually important which prvents long
          term success.</br>
          He warns that those who dont design a plan for their life they will fall into someone else's who might not
          have
          much plan for them.</p>
        <h4>Chapter 6 Summary</h4>
        <p>In this chapter Charlie teaches Micheal about the power of association, he tells him that the people he
          spends
          time with can have a major influence on his habits, attitude and results.
          He tells Micheal that joining an easy crowd won't give him a chance to grow and that he should go where
          expectations are high, Micheal then realizes that he often spend time with people who settle for less.
          Charlie then encourages him to seek out peopl who are more positive and success driven.
        </p>
        <h4>Chapter 7 Summary</h4>
        <p>Charlie shares with Micheal that continuous learning and personal growth are necessary for success and
          encourages him read good books, listen to more educational material and try to learn from others, as knowledge
          and self education are more valuable than formal schooling alone.
          Charlie gave Micheal a list of books that he recomends reading, Micheal realizes that that success requires
          constant learning and self-improvment and accepts the help he was given.
        </p>
        <h4>What I learned</h4>
        <p>Inorder for me to be successful in life i must decide on goals i want to achieve, allocate and use my time
          wisely, sorround myself with other who want to reach higher and always work on improving myself.</p>
